# Convenient Interface to Inverse Ising 
Authors: Edward D Lee, Bryan C Daniels

Python package for solving maximum entropy problems with a focus on the pairwise maximum
entropy model, also known as the inverse Ising problem.

See "ipynb/usage_guide.ipynb" for usage documentation and examples.

There is an accompanying guide on arXiv: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08216].

## Installation This package is available on PyPI for Linux and MacOS. It can be installed
by running  
>`pip install coniii`

If you have trouble using `pip` and PyPI, then you can always build this from source.
Download this package from GitHub and move the `coniii` folder to wherever you would like
to have the module.  Inside `coniii`, you must run
> `python setup_module.py build_ext --inplace`

If you would like to use the `Enumerate` solver for system sizes greater than 9, you must
run exact.py to write those files yourself. This can be run from the install directory.
If you do not know where the installation directory is, you can find it by opening up an
iPython notebook and running
> `import coniii`  `coniii.__path__`

Once inside the install directory, you can run in your bash shell
>`python exact.py [N]` 

where `[N]` should be replaced by the size of the system.

## Usage examples
The Jupyter notebook with the examples for how to use CONIII is available in the ipynb
directory on the Github: 
[https://github.com/bcdaniels/coniii/blob/master/ipynb/usage_guide.ipynb]

It is also installed into your environment directory if you use pip. If you do not know
how to navigate to your Python site-packages directory, I would recommend that you just
download it from the Github.

Make sure you copy the notebook into a directory outside the CONIII directory. Once in the
directory into which you've installed it, you can run it with
> jupyter notebook

Make sure that you are running Python 2 in that directory. If you run
> python

The first few lines specifying the version of Python that you are using must be 2.7. We
have not updated it to be compatible with Python 3.
